This plugin extends the O'DailyQuests API to add a simple walk quest type to the plugin.
If it doesn't work for you, message me on discord or something (fjcx)

You need the O'DailyQuests plugin, made by Ordwen to run this plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/odailyquests-daily-quests-plugin-1-16-1-20.100990/
Check out his discord for snapshot versions with experimental features: https://discord.gg/NPAUE7kTgJ

You should be able to build this plugin without a local jarfile now, thanks Ordwen.

Oh yea, Java 21 is still required.
